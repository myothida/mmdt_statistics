```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
```

### Prerequisites
These tutorials assume basic knowledge of Python programming. If you're new to Python, we recommend starting with a beginner-friendly Python tutorial or course. Additionally, some tutorials may require familiarity with basic statistical concepts.
