## Installation

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Required Libraries

In these tutorials, we use several Python libraries, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, and `statsmodels`. To install these libraries, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
```

### Prerequisites
These tutorials assume basic knowledge of Python programming. If you're new to Python, we recommend starting with a beginner-friendly Python tutorial or course. Additionally, some tutorials may require familiarity with basic statistical concepts.
