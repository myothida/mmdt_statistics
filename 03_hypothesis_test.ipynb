    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It is commonly used in various fields, including social sciences, business, medicine, and more. The process involves testing a claim or hypothesis about a population parameter.\n",

    "#### What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing allows us to test whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to support a particular belief or hypothesis about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hypothesis** is a statement or assumption about a population parameter (such as the mean, proportion, or variance). \n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, you typically have two competing hypotheses:\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The default assumption, stating that there is no effect or no difference.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**: The hypothesis you are trying to prove, stating that there is an effect or a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "#### Steps in Hypothesis Testing\n",

    "**Data Screening and Outliers**\n",
    "- visually inspect the data\n",
    "- Find extreme samples, and check them carefully.\n",
    "- Determine the data-type of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normality Check**\n",
    "- Parametirc Tests: Assume that the data can be well described by a distribution\n",
    "- Nonparametric Test: do not depend on the data following a specific distribution. \n",

    "| **Take Random Sample** | A random sample is drawn from a population.|\n",
    "| **1. State the Hypotheses** | - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The default assumption, stating no effect or difference. <br> - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**: The hypothesis you want to test, stating there is an effect or difference. |\n",
    "| **2. Set the Significance Level (α)** | The significance level (α) represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values are: <br> - α = 0.05 (5%) <br> - α = 0.01 (1%) <br> - α = 0.10 (10%) |\n",
    "| **3. Choose the Type of Test** | The type of hypothesis test depends on the data and the hypothesis: <br> - **Z-Test**: Large sample or known population variance. <br> - **T-Test**: Small sample with unknown variance. <br> - **Chi-Square Test**: Categorical data. <br> - **ANOVA**: Comparing means across three or more groups. |\n",
    "| **4. Compute the Test Statistic** | Calculate the test statistic (e.g., z-statistic or t-statistic) based on your sample data. This statistic quantifies how much the sample data deviate from the null hypothesis. |\n",
    "| **5. Determine the P-Value or Critical Value** | - **P-Value**: The probability of obtaining the test statistic at least as extreme as the one calculated, assuming H₀ is true. <br> - **Critical Value**: A threshold value to help decide whether to reject H₀. |\n",
    "| **6. Make a Decision** | - **Reject H₀** if p-value < α. <br> - **Fail to Reject H₀** if p-value ≥ α. |\n",
    "| **7. Interpret the Results** | Based on the decision, interpret the results in the context of the research question. |\n",
